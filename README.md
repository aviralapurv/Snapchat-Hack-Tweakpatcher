============

###Requirements

* iOS device
* Free Apple Developer account
* Xcode
* Decrypted/cracked Snapchat IPA (Google is your friend)
* (optional, precompiled version already included) [DocsDylibLoader](https://github.com/Defying/DocsDylibLoader)


###Steps

* Install Xcode from the App Store
* Run it for the first time. It will ask you for your password to install some tools.
* [Download TweakPatcher](https://github.com/Defying/TweakPatcher/archive/master.zip)
* Uninstall Snapchat from the iOS device
* `cd` to the directory where `tweakpatcher.sh` is located.
* Move your decrypted Snapchat IPA into the directory where `tweakpatcher.sh` is located.
* There are two methods to running this script:
* 1) Run `./tweakpatcher.sh patch snapplus Snapchat.ipa` if you don't already have a provisioning profile. It will generate one to use.
* 2) Run `./tweakpatcher.sh patch snapplus Snapchat.ipa BUNDLE_ID` if you already have a provisioning profile and don't want to flood your Apple ID.
* Follow the on screen instructions.
* You should now have SnapPlus installed onto your jailed iOS device!
